Coding interview cheat-sheet + some code.

Checkout the cheat-sheet **[here]()**.

The raw `.md` is provided in the source. As it includes some (basic) maths, I suggest the use a markdown editor that supports latex ([MarkText](https://marktext.github.io/website/), [Typora](https://typora.io/), [Hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io), ...).
