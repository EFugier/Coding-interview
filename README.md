Coding interview reference 
===
This repo contains:
* A coding interview cheat-sheet providing the main ideas and method, as well as complexity and data structure fundamentals.
* Some code solving some common interview question (intended for personnal use but you can have a look).

Checkout the cheat-sheet **[here](https://EFugier.github.io/Coding-interview)**.

The raw `.md` is provided in the source. As it includes some (basic) maths, I suggest the use a markdown editor that supports latex ([MarkText](https://marktext.github.io/website/), [Typora](https://typora.io/), [Hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io), ...).
