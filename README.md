Coding interview reference 
===
Coding interview cheat-sheet + some code.

## MD
As the cheat sheet includes some maths, I suggest you use a markdown editor that supports latex. ([Typora](https://typora.io/), [Hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io), ...)

## HTML
If you just want to read it open the [clean html](cheat-sheet.html) generated by hackmd.
